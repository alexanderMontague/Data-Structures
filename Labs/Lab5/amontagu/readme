Program Description
####################
This program was created to test the functionality of a stack implicated as a linked list. It squashes numbers.

Additional Program  Details
####################

- I did not implement the API EXACTLY as wanted. I did not really understand the point of doing all the extra steps, and linking the function pointers in this case. I understand the importance for another time, where you might not have access to all the functions needed. I on the other hand did, and was on a limited time schedule, as I have midterms and other work to do. I actually understand linked lists and how they work really good from these assignments, but the way that they are implemented are sort of new to be, and I do not understand how I am to be using them correctly

- Other than that, the program should still have the exact same functionality that is needed for this program, while implementing a stack and linked list.
