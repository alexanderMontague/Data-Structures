Assignment 4

Program Description
####################
This program was created to showcase the functionality of a Binary Search Tree through a personal assistant app.

Personalization
####################
The only thing that I did to personalize anything was create the recursive wrapper functions so that I could iterate. Thats about it. 

Additional Program  Details
####################
- FOR ALL INPUT FILES - Please make sure that there is a newline after the last line of data for both the dictionary and word input files. I have included the example files with a newline in the assets folder

- Run the program using   ./program <file path>   Ex. If the file were to be in the assets folder, you would run ./program ../assets/<filename> or as an example, when asked for the input word file, type ../assets/a3_userFile.txt
