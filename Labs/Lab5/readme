Program Description
####################
This program was supposedly created to test the functionality, and usability of a doubly linked list. This program uses a doubly linked list to simulate traffic.

Additional Program  Details
####################

Just to preface this assignment, I really did not understand the simulation part of the program at all, thus my output is probably not correct. I tried my best and will hopefully get some part marks for the output style and such, but I really had no clue as to how the simulation portion works. I hope in the future the assignments are verified in the assignment specifications and not conveyed through the discussion boards. I am not blaming anyone, but I, along with what I assume are multiple others, would really benefit from a better and clear to the point explanation of the assignment. Thanks for your time.

1) I included the insert sort function, and it is fully functional. Please test it as I need the bonus marks.

2) Place the input files in the /assets/ folder. Run the program by make, then running   ./program <filename.txt>      I have configured it so you do not need to type a path or anything.

3) In my deleteNodeFromList function in APIfunctions.c, I included the “car.h” file as I needed it for this function. To my knowledge and extensive googling, there is no direct way to compare structs or unions in C. The only way is to compare each member individually, which I do here. deleteNode->data == findDeleted->data does not work. I have tried. Hopefully I do not lose too many marks for this, but I did not know of another way.

4) Please test the linked list extensively, as it is the only thing that works as of now. I had no idea how to do the simulation. Linked list is tested in testMain.c
