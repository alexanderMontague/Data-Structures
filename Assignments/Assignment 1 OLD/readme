Program Description
####################
This program creates linked lists for integer and book types. The program also includes functionality in the API, that lets you access and mutate the linked list.

Additional Program  Details
####################
1) Some benefits of testing with multiple data types are that it allows you to check that everything works the way it should, no matter the data type. If you only test with one data type, you might not be sure if another data type will break your program, or cause unwanted output. 

2) I believe that the signature of the print function does not need to be changed to test the functionality of the method, as a void pointer being the only parameter, and there being no return function suffices. The only thing that changes from my print functions is how the void pointer is processed. You have to print a book and integer differently 

3) No, this function does not remove the first element. This function only retrieves the element and does not delete it. I tested this by printing the list, calling the getFromFront function, and then printing the list again after. The results showed that no elements were deleted from the list, much less the first element. This function does not delete any elements, whereas the deleteNodeFromList function does.
