—PLEASE READ—
- My program for some reason does not run on the socs virtual machine. I have absolutely no idea why and have spent the past 2 hours trying to debug with valgrind and gdb with no success. Please, if you could, can you run my program on a modern machine. I coded the program on MAC OSX, and it had absolutely no problems. When I went to switch over to the virtual machine just to check, I was met with a seg fault that I could not debug. The program is fully functional on all the other machines I have tested with, just not the socs box. I have no idea why. Please don’t fail me, my program actually works as specified just not on the virtual machine :(.

- Run the program using   ./program <file path>   Ex. If the file were to be in the assets folder, you would run ./program ../assets/<filename>

- Did not attempt the starvation algorithm
